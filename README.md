# Control Theory

I have worked on a few educational projects related to "Control Theory" using the Godot engine.

These projects have allowed me to explore the concepts of feedback control, system stability, and optimal control strategies in a fun and interactive way. The Godot engine's flexible scripting language and intuitive visual editor have made it easy to prototype and iterate on different control systems.

In this repository, you will find a control theory concept - Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers, implemented in Godot. There are interactive demos that allow you to experiment with different control parameters and see how they affect the system behavior.

Whether you are a student learning about control theory for the first time or a seasoned engineer looking for a new tool to prototype control systems, I hope that these examples will be useful to you. Please feel free to fork this repository and use the code in your own projects, or contribute your own examples and improvements back to the community.
